# Gold-Price-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning-FastAPI
This project is a real-time gold price forecasting system that leverages deep learning models (LSTM, Bi-LSTM, Stacked LSTM) and a FastAPI-based interface. It uses historical data and external economic indicators like silver, crude oil, and the S&amp;P 500 index to predict gold prices.

üß† Models Used
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional LSTM)
Stacked LSTM

‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Technologies
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
FastAPI
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
MinMaxScaler (for normalization)
VS Code / Jupyter Notebook
